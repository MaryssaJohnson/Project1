//Depending on which one of these we have case statements for every individual item. 
//Start by saying switch and the choice that we have gotten froom the user is going to now be the one that we are going to use to find out out which one of these cases we're going to go to and excute.
//In this case we have case 1, 2, 3, and 4.
// add: If I don't input a  break statement, the program will fall through and execute every single case.
